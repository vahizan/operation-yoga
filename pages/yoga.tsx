          The Mission of Veda Yogshala is to share the eternal wisdom,
          knowledge, and philosophy of yoga, which has been passed through the
          ancient yogic traditions.

          We believe that traditional Yoga should be taught comprehensively. The
          courses are designed according to the studentâ€™s experience and
          ability, but embedded in the traditional knowledge which should be
          passed on, as we believe that with the right approach, students can
          benefit the most and further enhance their lives.
